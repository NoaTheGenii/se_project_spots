# Project 3: Spots

### Overview  
Using my knowledge of html structure and css language, I created a copy of the "Spots" page 
  
**Intro**
  
For this project, I had to create a file structure to match the website, "Spots," from Figma.
It has html and css as the coding languages. And within the files, I have used flexbox, grid, and BEM file structure to create a cohesive and coherent code that behaves responsively on all screen sizes.
